                    Katie has been immersed in music her whole life. She took 10 years of piano lessons 
                    and sang in choirs from middle school through college. She loves making music with her 
                    whole family who play various instruments (piano, trombone, clarinet, euphonium, flute, 
                    guitar, drums). In 2021, she's excited to be joining the
                    <a href="https://singomahachoirs.org/women" target="_blank">Sing Omaha Women's Choir</a>.
                    Katie also dabbles in music composition and production and would love to one day write music for a video game.

                    Since her older brother introduced her to Nintendo's Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as a child, Katie 
                    has loved video games, with a particular interest in the 
                    <a href="https://www.zelda.com/" target="_blank">Legend of Zelda series</a>.
                    She gravitates toward games with immersive worlds, well-structured stories, and a good mix of puzzles and combat. 
                    Her favorite Zelda titles are Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask, and Ocarina of Time. Katie also likes playing indie games, including two of her current favorites, 
                    <a href="http://www.celestegame.com/" target="_blank">Celeste</a>

                    Katie has been running since 2018 when she started working for the Air Force Marathon and figured 
                    if she was going to be part of putting on a running event, she should probably start running herself. 
                    As someone who doesn't think of herself as an 'athlete,' she loves that running gives her an easy way 
                    to stay fit and motivated. She enjoys her solo runs, but especially loves the joy and excitement that 
                    comes with doing an official race, and has run several 5ks and 10ks as well as two half marathons. She 
                    is currently training for her first full marathon in 2021 and runs about 30 miles every week.

                    During her two years in this role, Katie handled all of the customer service for the Air Force Marathon 
                    events which typically has about 12,000 participants. She was also in charge of set-up and oversight of 
                    the runner registration site/database. She loved working with a small team of 7 people and being able to 
                    see the different stages of event planning culminating in the excitement of race weekend.

                    Katie received her first bachelor's degree from UW-Eau Claire in 2017. She majored in English 
                    and minored in Spanish. Throughout her time there, she grew her writing and communication skills 
                    and studied abroad in Valladolid, Spain. She also took several unique honors classes including a 
                    digital game design class, which is what inspired her to pursue a second degree in software development from

                    In January 2019, Katie and her husband Adam adopted two kittens: Clara and Anton. They're named after composers 
                    Clara Schumann and Anton Bruckner due to Katie and Adam's shared love of music. While they aren't biologically related, 
                    they get along just as siblings would: play fighting and getting annoyed with each other half of the time, and cuddling 
                    and grooming each other the other half.
